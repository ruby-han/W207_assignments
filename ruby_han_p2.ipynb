    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "**Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not work well for this problem due to the high dimension of feature space (26879) and sparse nature of the feature matrix. All the data points are wide apart and the training dataset does not provide good sampling of the feature space. Due to the sparsity of the feature matrix (huge vocabulary but each document does not contain most words), the kNN model experiences difficulty distinguishing one document to the next. This is also made worse when common words such as 'is', 'the', 'to' and so on are prevalent between documents and are given additional importance in the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression does not work as well as Naive Bayes Multinomial in this case as the events are somewhat independent (although word placement/grammar is not independent, bag-of-words modelling style on features create independence without preserving word context) which leads to better prediction. In addition, the training dataset is small, the model is generative and non-linear. The high amount of common words produces noisiness and thus, it is hard to fit an accurate line in the logistic regression model. If the training data size is increased, the logistic regression model is expected to perform better compared to current.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "C-value is inversely proportional to strength of regularization/penalty. As C increases, the sum of squared weights increases. In other words, the higher the C-value, the lower the regularization strength/penalty, the higher the number of features used. Regularization penalizes large coefficients and drives them towards zero to reduce overfitting as well as increase parsimony of the model."

    "### Part 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several L1 regularization strengths ...<br/>\n",
    "* Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.  Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary and **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* Train on the transformed training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001)."

A reduction in vocabulary size indicates a reduction in model complexity. However, if performance becomes worse when complexity is decreased, it means that there is an opportunity to increase model complexity in order to improve generalization."

    "`CountVectorizer` computes a specific feature frequency in each document while `TfidfVectorizer` does the same thing in addition to multiplying the frequency with its inverse frequency across all documents. The disadvantage of the `CountVectorizer` is that the document size is not accounted for thus the bias of overweighting features that appear several times in a smaller document size will occur. As `TfidfVectorizer` takes into account all documents and normalizes the frequency of each feature based on document size, biases of overweighting or underweighting features are smaller.\n",

    "Overall, the f1-score for the `TfidfVectorizer` is higher than `CountVectorizer`. However, frequency does not always suggest importance especially in terms of stop words. Words could mean differently based on context. We used R ratio to rank the top three examples that are mislabelled. It basically describes the probability of a topic being mislabelled. \n",
    "\n",
    "An issue we observed is that the model mislabelled two `talk.religion.misc` topics as `comp.graphics` instead as it is putting more emphasis on terms such as postscript, ftp site, postscript, email, RTF, internet, email and so on. In reality, 'Mormon' probably should have been weighted higher although the frequency was low. In the third example, `alt.atheism` and `talk.religion.misc` topics have many terms in common thus it is not surprising that both topics are easily misclassified. \n",
